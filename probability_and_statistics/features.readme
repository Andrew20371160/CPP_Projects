o Euler-tour based design of all the functions in the library which reduced code significantly.
o Set Operations: Union, intersection, complement, difference, symmetric difference, containment,
equality, and independence tests.
o Probability Calculations: Probability of events, conditional probability, Bayes theorem, probability of
unions and intersections, statistical analysis (mean, variance, standard deviation, median, range),
probability mass function (PMF), and cumulative mass function (CMF).
o Data Structures: Binary search trees (BSTs) for efficient storage and retrieval, and Euler tour for
efficient traversal and operations.
o Efficient Algorithms: The library employs optimized algorithms for set operations and probability
calculations, ensuring fast execution times.
o Flexible Data Types: The library can handle various data types, making it adaptable to different
applications.
o Extensible Design: The modular architecture allows for easy integration into other projects and
customization.
o Comprehensive Functionality: The library provides a wide range of functions for set operations and
probability calculations, covering most common use cases.
o High Performance: The library is optimized for both speed and memory efficiency
