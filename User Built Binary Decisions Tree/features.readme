o Tree Construction:
▪ Users can enter questions and answers via a simple command-line interface.
▪ Build the tree from a user-filled text file using a breadth-first approach.
▪ Construct the tree from an array provided by the user, also in a breadth-first manner.
o Modes of Operation: Two distinct modes: one for creating a new tree and another for interacting with the
existing tree.
o File Management: Save and load trees from files, maintaining the original structure using a breadth-first
mechanism.
o Multiple Trees: Support for multiple trees stored in a list, along with a console interface for user
interaction.
o Search Functionality: Search for questions by typing them directly or by entering patterns of answers
leading to specific questions.
o Tree Management:
▪ Update existing questions.
▪ Remove questions/answers while relocating their child subtrees appropriately, ensuring no memory
leaks.
▪ Delete the entire tree or specific subtrees with no memory leakage
