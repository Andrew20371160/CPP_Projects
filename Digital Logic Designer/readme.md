7/23/2024 update :
1-fixed a memory leak that would be caused if you removed the root node
2-added xnor and buffer gates


The idea of the project revolves around digital logic design. It aims to provide a board or graph where you can design some complex logic components (as close as it can to real-life).

from logic gates : and, or, not... ....etc

In the main you can find a testing code that I've made.

I've fixed and eliminated a lot of segmentation faults and memory leaks; it's stable now (though if there is a segmentation fault, please let me know).

This is still in beta, and I will add more updates to it

One of the updates I want to make is the ability to save and load a component after designing it to reuse it.

Feel free to use any code :)
