o Matrix Creation and Manipulation: The library allows for the creation of matrices with different data
types (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers), initialization, and various
manipulation operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and transposition.
o Matrix Operations: It supports common matrix operations such as determinant calculation, inverse
computation, trace calculation, rank determination, and eigenvector/eigenvalue analysis.
o Matrix Types: The library provides a feature to identify the matrix type (e.g., Symmetric, orthogonal,
etc.) and based on that information it optimizes certain operations (e.g., Matrix multiplication).
o Matrix Compression: For specific matrix types (e.g., triangular matrices, symmetric matrices), the
library can efficiently compress the matrix data to save memory.
o Linear Algebra Functions: It provides functions for solving linear systems of equations, performing QR
factorization, singular value decomposition (SVD), and least squares fitting.
o Vector Operations: The library also includes functions for vector operations like dot product, cross
product, normalization, and angle calculation.
o Matrix Transformations: It supports matrix transformations such as rotation, scaling, and translation.
o Fourier Transform: The library implements the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm for efficient
signal processing.
o Matrix Analysis: It offers functions to check matrix properties like symmetry, orthogonality,
idempotency, nilpotency, and positive definiteness.
o Customizable Tolerance: The library allows users to adjust the tolerance level used in numerical
calculations to control accuracy and precision.
