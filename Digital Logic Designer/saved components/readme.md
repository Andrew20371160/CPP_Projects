here I will save already built components through out the toturial of the overly complicated system i made
the idea is simple 
each tree is independent from the other 
so here half adder which is one component but it has 2 output pins 

one which is the sum (half_adder0.txt)
and the other is the carry(half_adder1.txt)

first load the sum then the carry at the right or vice-versa 
it works will keep updating this overly complicated system
