Here I will add files for components Built through out the series.

Link to the series: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbDnyrrfgzH6rByhw83TfR-hEWR1vLolN]

when loading a component just type the path and then component's name as you typed it like this:
path\ha

where ha is the component's name and don't add any indexing or extension that's it :)
