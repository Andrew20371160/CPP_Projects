The idea of the project revolves around digital logic design 
it aims to provide a board or graph where you can design some complex logic components (as close as it can to real-life)

from logic gates : and ,or ,not ....etc

in the main you can find a testing code i've made 

I've fixed and eliminated a lot of segmentation faults and memory leaks 
it's stable now (though if there is a seg-fault please let me know)

this is till in the beta and will add more updates to it 

one of the updates i wanna make is the ability to save a component after designing and the ability to reuse it.

Feel free to use any code :)
