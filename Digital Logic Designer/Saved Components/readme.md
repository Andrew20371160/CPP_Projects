Here I will add files for components Built through out the series.
Link to the series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNgUllowSiA&list=PLbDnyrrfgzH4v5_NiBz46QS6W0CPb2-qB

when loading a component just type the path and then component's name as you typed it like this:
path\ha

where ha is the component's name and don't add any indexing or extension that's it :)
